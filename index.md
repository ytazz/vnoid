# Challenge 2024

## Aim of this challenge

The aim of this challenge is to provide students and researchers in the humanoid robotics research community
 with a common development platform and an opportunity for competition and
 thereby facilitate cutting-edge research in this field
 through the sharing of knowledge, ideas, and technical resources.

Compared to several simulation-based humanoid robot competitions held in the past (e.g., JVRC, DRC, WRS, Robocup),
 the major uniqueness of this challenge is that it focuses of the potential ability of humanoid robots to perform acrobatic movements.

## How to participate

- This challenge takes place based on participants' submissions of simulation log data.
- If you would like to participate in the challenge, please submit application information
  from the link shown below not later than the application deadline.
- After application, you will receive a link for uploading simulation log data.
- After that, you can submit simulation log data at any time during the period of challenge.
  Submitted data will be checked by the steering committee if it conforms with the regulation,
   and if qualified, will appear in the list of qualified submissions shown in this webpage.

## Challenge Themes

### Athletics

The robot traverses the athletic field from the starting position to the goal.
Performance is evaluated by reached landmark and elapsed simulation time.

-->

### Dance

The robot performs dancing that requires whole-body motion.
Dance performance is evaluated in terms of both artistic quality and technical quality.

-->

### Short track

The robot walks/runs the 20[m] short track.
Performance is evaluated by elapsed simluation time while the robot passes the start line and the goal line.
